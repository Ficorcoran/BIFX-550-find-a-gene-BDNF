## Summary

This project aimed to identify the gene Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) in a species which it had not been described, using homo sapiens as a reference. A shark which had recently had its genome sequenced--Carcharhinus cautus (Nervous Shark)--was identified as a candidate. As the shark had a whole genome sequence GCA_988281185.1, but had not yet been added to the BLAST database, the genome was downloaded as a FASTA file and tblastn was run locally, finding a strong match. This candidate was then confirmed with reciprocal best hit and analyzing the function of the sequences with the greatest amount of changes.

## Workflow

| Step | Task | Tool | Output |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Choose a starting protein | UniProt or NCBI Protein | `data/` |
| 2 | Search for a candidate novel gene | tBLASTn against WGS or TSA | `results/blast/` |
| 3 | Retrieve and translate the ORF | GenBank record, ORF translation | `data/` |
| 4 | Confirm novelty | BLASTp against nr | `results/blast/` |
| 5 | Multiple sequence alignment | [Clustal Omega, MUSCLE, MAFFT, or T-Coffee] | `results/msa/` |
| 6 | Phylogenetic tree | [MEGA or IQ-TREE; method] | `results/tree/` |
| 7 | Structure prediction and comparison | [AlphaFold, ColabFold, or SWISS-MODEL; Mol* or ChimeraX] | `results/structure/` |
| 8 | Selection analysis (optional) | [HyPhy or PAML] | `results/selection/` |
| 9 | Discussion | | `report/` |

Tool versions, access dates, and parameters for every step are recorded in [scripts/README.md](scripts/README.md).

## Key results

### Novelty
[What the BLASTp search against nr returned and why the candidate counts as novel.]

### Alignment and phylogeny
[Conserved regions; where the novel protein falls in the tree; support values.]

### Structure
[Prediction confidence; similarity to the closest PDB entry; notable differences.]

## Limitations and next steps

[What the evidence cannot show, and what you would test next.]

## Reproducing this analysis

Inputs are in `data/`. Every step, with its tool, version or access date, parameters, input, and output, is listed in the analysis log in [scripts/README.md](scripts/README.md). Following that log in order reproduces the results in `results/`.

## Use of AI tools

[Name any AI tool that contributed materially and describe how, or write "None."]
